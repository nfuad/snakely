# Snakely

## A React Snake Game.

This game was built as a fun project with React, Next.js, Typescript, etc. You can find some tests written with Jest and Enzyme. Special Credits: Paper CSS, Sweet Alert, React Use Interval Hook by Dan Abramov, and all the other libraries used to get the project done. Play it here: https://snakely.now.sh
